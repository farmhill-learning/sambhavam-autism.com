Are you interested in working with neurodiverse children and their families?

Do you see that working with children goes beyond offering skills training and needs deep understanding of teaching-learning processes across cogntive, emotional and social dimensions?

Are you willing to spend the time and energy needed to learn the attitudes and skills needed to make an impact in the lives of people?

If yes, this is for you! 

Hopefully you have read through this website, and about our other projects - Subodha Learning Community and Farm Hill Learning. We are a community of practitioners committed to working with children and their families - both neurotypical and neurodiverse - across age groups and contexts. Team members here have expertise across areas like parenting, education, neurodiversity, counselling, farming, alternative living, community building etc.
