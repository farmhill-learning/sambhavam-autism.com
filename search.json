    "text": "Well begun is half done! Good start is important for anything we do. We are satisfied that we started our life journey through autism in Sambhavam. Though we started the intervention service very late for our son, we could see many changes within few days. He could start following instructions, his pointing skills and sitting tolerance was improved. We realized that puzzles is his strength. Though he is still under toilet training, it is much better now. His eating habits were Improved. Thanks to Chithra for her proper guidance given to parents in every small thing in the daily routine. Thanks to Sambhavam team for their kind support. Sambhavam gave us confidence for our future journey. Keep up the good work Chithra and team!\n\n– Parents of a 4 year old\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSambhavam run by Chithra and Venu was something that we stumbled upon after trying out ABA in quite a few places. What really stuck us at first about Sambhavam was the energy & passion of both Chithra and Venu. Both of them having learnt stuff the hard way, wanted to make it easy for other parents and did not want us to go through all the hardships that they had faced. What we really liked was that it was a full day program unlike the 2 hours slot that others were providing. Some of the things that our son learnt (that he had never learnt it anywhere else) was adherence to schedule, sitting tolerance for up to 6 hours, playing piano, signing, painting craftwork, we were able to control his behavior better (techniques for controlling his behavior were taught to us) and eating food by sitting in one place. A lot of the credit for this has to go to Chithra for making this happen. This was apart from all the academic learnings that were part of the schedule. A very good place for kids on the spectrum and from our own experience very helpful if you get them here as early as possible.\n\n– Parents of a 5 year old boy\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nVenu was my colleague from office. He nd Chithra were the ones we turned to when our son was first diagnosed with autism. They have been of tremendous help, support and guidance throughout the last 3 years. We reside in Mumbai and we have been regularly visiting Chithra for periodic assessment and therapy every 6 months. She also provides us with a program and outlines the goals/milestones to be achieved over the next 6 months. We have noticed that unlike most other centres where you have a one size fits all kind of approach; here a lot of care, attention and thought is spared towards each individual. We have seen our son make tremendous progress over these years. Thanks a lot for your care and efforts!\n\n– Parents of a 6 year old\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nOur daughter ‘Titli’ is now almost 4 yrs old. She started going to “Sambhavam” from mid January 2016. We opted for ABA therapy because she was unable to communicate her basic needs to us. Through these last 6 months, Titli has started communicating to us through PECS and pointing to objects that she wants. Her understanding of language is now excellent. Her social skills are improving and she has also started imitating very well. We are thankful to Chithra and her team of therapists for their support, hard work, and patience. Above all, what we like most about “Sambhavam”, is their transparency and their willingness to listen to our worries. We know that Chithra is always a call away to help us. We would say that finally we can see our daughter blossoming under their guidance.\n\n– Parents of Titli"

    "text": "Early Intervention\n\nAssessments and IEP\nWhen we start working with a child, we perform a comprehensive set of assessments to identify their strengths and developmental needs. These assessments include behavior assessments, cognitive assessments, communication assessments and motor assessments. Based on the current abilities of the child, we identify the next set of goals and the methods to work with them. This leads to the development of a detailed Individual Education Program (IEP). IEP then becomes basis of all our conversations about the child’s learning journey. Progress is tracked along the goals and IEP is updated periodically with new goals.\n\n\nOne to one ABA Therapy\nWe offer two hours of Applied Behavior Analysis based therapy to every child, every day from Monday to Friday. During ABA therapy sessions, we focus on various goals in language development, cognitive development, self help skills and motor skills. With young children, we specifically work on toilet training and eating habits. Each therapy sessions is one to one - there is a therapist dedicated to the child during this time.\n\n\n\nTherapy session in progress\n\n\nOur time slots are 9.15 am to 11.15 am, 11.45 to 1.45 pm and 2.30pm to 4.30pm. Each family can choose a slot comfortable for them.\n\n\nSpeech Language Therapy\nA two way channel of communication is a very important need, especially for children on the spectrum. Since communication challenges are among the key features of autism, many children benefit from speech and language therapy. However, speech therapy is not just about speech or language but about holistic communication.\nAt sambhavam, we offer speech therapy in 45 minutes sessions per day, at a frequency recommended by our therapists, based on the needs of the child. We also train non-verbal or minimally verbal children and their parents on the use of Assisted and Augmented Communication systems like PECS, AWAZ etc.\n\n\nOccupational Therapy\nOccupational Therapy is among the top therapies recommended for autism. The general focus of OT is to improve the child’s ability to participate in activities of daily living, which may include things like dressing or brushing teeth.\n\n\n\nAn OT session\n\n\nDuring OT sessions, the focus is on improving fluency in gross motor actions like climbing stairs, fine motor actions like using a pencil or a paint brush, daily living skills like tying shoelaces and social functioning goals like catching a ball.\nAt sambhavam we offer 45 minute OT sessions, at a frequency recommended by our therapists."

    "text": "Academic Support\n\nShadow Teachers\nMost schools these days require a shadow teacher to be with the child in the classroom to support the child during the day. We offer the services of well trained shadow teachers. In addition to providing support in school, children we work with come to our center periodically, along with their shadow teachers, so that we can continue to train them together and address any emerging challenges and requirements. We worj collaboratively with parents and the school to ensure the child gets the best learning experience.\n\n\nRemedial Programs\nRemedial programs are offered to school going children, who may require specific support in academic, social and leisure skills. We offer remedial programs in the evenings, to suit the time tables of the children. Very often, we partner with the parents and the school so that the child can derive the maximum benefit.\n\n\nHomeschooling Support\nAn increasing number of parents realise that the standardised, main stream schooling does not cater to the specific requirements of their child. Most of the parents who are willing to spend the time and energy needed to work with their own children, still feel unsupported and alone in their journeys. They feel they can benefit from the social support of like-minded families, as well as academic support from experienced educators and therapists. We provide such support through our Subodha project.\n\n\n\nHomeschool group session"

    "text": "Trainings & Workshops\n\nParent Training\nFor most parents, a diagnosis of autism comes as a shock. These days, autism is relatively well known but that is not to say it is well understood. Often, parents are bombarded with information from various experts, and expectations from various quarters. All of this points to genuine need - parents need help in making sense of autism, and how to deal with it in their own lives. At the minimum, they should be able to understand the inputs they get from various therapists and make sense of them. At best, they should be grow to be able to manage their child’s support needs entirely by themselves.\nThese are the goals of our parent training programs. We offer an ongoing training program to any parent interested in working with and learning alongside their child. You can talk to us any time to join this program.\nIn addition, we offer periodic workshops and webinars. Please watch our blog or get in touch with us to know about the latest.\n\n\nAwareness Programs and Workshops\nAnother issue faced by people who are living with autism is the public ignorance about autism and how it manifests in children. We all wish people around us understood autism better!\nWe take the wish forward and conduct awareness workshops and events, primarily aimed at reaching more and more people with information about autism. The most prominent of these is our annual Autism Awareness Event, which usually happens in the first week of April every year.\n\n\n\nAutism Awareness 2024\n\n\nAdditionally, we conduct awareness workshops and webinars on demand. Please get in touch with us if you want to organise an awareness workshop/event/webinar in your community - your apartment complex, workplace, or any other social group you are part of.\n\n\nInternships\nIn India, there are very few places that offer autism specific professional training. Mosst professionals who study psychology, social work or allied subjects are barely aware of autism and are completely out of touch with the reality of living with autism. This adds to the challenge of finding entusiastic, well trained therapists.\nOur internship programs are aimed at providing a structured, experiential learning experience to students and fresh graduates. We hope to show them the joys of working in this space, and the impact they can make. We offer internships without any charges to the interns and hope that the exposure they get disposes them positively towards continuing to work in the autism/neurodiverse space.\n\nNeed support for your child?\nGet in touch for expert help!\nContact Us"

    "text": "In this final part of a 4 article series about eating interventions that can help neurodiverse children, we discuss practical ways to help children who eat too fast or too slow.\nThe other common issue with neurodiverse children is that they eat either too fast or too slow. Some finish an entire meal in 5 minutes; some take up to 2 hours to eat a snack.\nTypically, in either case, the child does not chew properly and it affects digestion. The quick eaters usually eat quite a lot of food before their hunger and palate are satisfied. This leads to weight gain and associated negative loops. The slow eaters tend to pocket the food in the mouth - this affects their oral hygiene. Also, the food tastes bland after being in the mouth for a long time and they lose interest."

The child has a smiley chart and a bowl.\n\nOnce the child takes one spoonful of food into the mouth, they fix the smileys from the bowl, on the chart. During this time, they keep chewing and the rule is they cannot take another mouthful till all the smileys are fixed.\nOnce all smileys are fixed, they take another spoonful of food.\nThis time, they pick the smileys from the chart and put them in the bowl.\nKeep doing this till the food is finished.\n\nOnce, we came across a child who would touch food and everything around with both hands. Smiley chart would have been unhygienic. We modified the intervention.\n\nA table mat, with spaces drawn for the child’s plate, glass and hands was created. The child was expected to keep the plate and glass on the mat, as well as keep their hands on the spaces indicated on the mat.\nA number line with numbers 1 to 10 was also drawn on the top of the mat.\nThe child takes a spoonful of food, and uses fingers to count from one to ten on the numberline. They chew while doing this.\nOnce the numbers are counted, they can take the next spoonful.\nThe mat structure helped the child keep their hands clean while eating, as well as introducing delay between spoonfuls through counting.\n\nIn both the above cases, the children were older than ten. All the prompts used to remind them to follow the sequence were either written or pictorial so there was not much verbal input, repeated instructions or anyone losing temper."

    "text": "Intervention for slow eaters\nWith slow eaters, the key is to create a limit on the time the child keeps food in the mouth. To do this, we mark the beginning and ending of each mouthful so the child has a cue for when the food should be swallowed. We also need to help the child keep track of how much they should eat and how much they have eaten. For this, we use checkboxes or tokens.\n\nEstablish the average quantity the child can comfortably eat. Measure this in bites, spoonfuls or mouthfuls.\nMake a visual schedule for the number of measures to be eaten. We provide tick boxes or tokens for each measure. For example, if the child has to eat 15 spoonfuls, we make 15 checkboxes or give 15 tokens.\nThe child takes food in the mouth. We start counting from 1 to 10, in a calm voice, to encourage the child to continue chewing. We can also draw a number line and progress on it if we want to avoid verbal input. This tells the child that they have to finish the mouthful within this count.\nAt the end of the count, the child ticks a box or counts down by removing a token.\nWe can plan a break for every 3 or 5 measures, so the child can pause and does not get overwhelmed. The intervention ends when the food is finished!\n\nYou can read the earlier articles below.\nEating Interventions: Attitudes towards food\nEating Interventions: Eating too little\nEating Interventions: Eating too fast or slow\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance.

    "text": "In this first part of a 4 article series about eating interventions that can help neurodiverse children, we deal with cultivating good attitudes towards food.\nBattles around food are an unavoidable part of being a parent. Children and parents seem to have completely different opinions about pretty much every aspect of food - what to eat, when to eat and how to eat.\nEating more than what we need, ‘indulging’, seems to be becoming a cultural norm. It does not help that more and more junk food is being engineered to create cravings. “No one can eat just one” is not a cute advertisement tagline any more, it is starting to sound more and more like a warning on an addictive substance!\nAt the same time, issues like picky eating, eating in a hurry, refusing to chew, not being able to maintain oral hygiene are on the rise. These issues become much more pronounced and difficult to handle with neurodiverse children, whose sensitivities and anxieties are as such difficult to live with.\nAs parents, our goal should be to help children eat good food in reasonable quantities at a sustained pace. In this article, we present a few thoughts and hands-on techniques to help neurodiverse children acquire and maintain good food habits."

    "text": "Cultivate a good attitude towards food\nFor many parents, food is synonymous with love. We can never hold back our love or their favourite food! Most of our children love food, they are fully attentive and engaged around it, and it is difficult to think how that love is impacting them. However, our love should empower them, make them healthy and independent.\nEating is a part of lifestyle. Also, modelling is very powerful. So, any change we expect in the food habits of the child has to be implemented by the entire family.\nThe family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for pooreaters.\nIt is important to plan balanced meals. Have a weekly meeting to plan the menu. Make space for favourite foods like samosas, popcorn or chicken burgers. Decide on the quantities. Even if your child is not verbal, make them a part of the meeting and let them respond with yes or no. All this activity builds predictability and reduces anxiety about favourite foods. You can use the menu as an opportunity to build #communication, create a sense of time through the #calendar, build it into their weekly #schedule, help them get into the habit of checking written instructions or schedules instead of asking the same questions again and again…the possibilities are endless! Remember our children love food and it is a great motivator.\nLast but not least, eat together as a family as frequently as you can. Show how to eat measured quantities of food. Talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can eat good, healthy food in moderate quantities and still be happy!\nYou can read the rest of the articles in this series below.\nEating Interventions: Eating too much\nEating Interventions: Eating too little\nEating Interventions: Eating too fast or slow\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance.

Children eat because food calms them down, it provides actual psychological comfort! Most neurodiverse children also do not have well developed interoception that tells them when they are full. Sometimes, food not being available makes them upset and aggressive.\n\n\n\nEating too much\n\n\nWhile food calms them down, overeating affects health negatively. It is necessary to address this.\n\nWhat to do\nFood and eating is a lifestyle issue. The entire family has to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of them. Working together and supporting each other is important.\n\nMake a weekly menu plan together. Include favourite as well as not favourite foods. The menu gives visibility of when favourite food is scheduled and helps prepare oneself for the not so favourite food. Remember to accommodate fancy food items and some junk food so there is no sense of deprivation.\nThe menu should cover all meals - midmorning snack, evening tea etc. If it is not on the menu, you do not eat it.\nAgree on measurements - we will have one samosa each; or one bowl of popcorn. Do not prepare or buy more than that.\nOn a daily basis, for every meal, everyone gets into the habit of measuring and eating - two rotis, one bowl of biryani etc. This shows them that everyone is following the same rules.\nRemember it is okay to say - “you have eaten your share. We can have this again - in the evening/tomorrow/next week” - as per your menu.\nTalk together, plan, do it together - modelling is very important.\n\nTake help of your therapists to handle any behaviours around food. Also, start when the children are young, it helps them get into good routines and helps everyone!\nYou can read the rest of the articles in this series here.\nEating Interventions: Attitudes towards food\nEating Interventions: Eating too little\nEating Interventions: Eating too fast or slow\nPlease note that these interventions are shared for general guidance.

It becomes a medical concern as the child’s immunity becomes low, they fall ill frequently, cannot play or move as they want to or like to, get irritated quickly which results in overall unhappiness and many behavioural issues. An unhappy child finds it difficult to learn or relate positively to learning.\nAgain, let us remember that eating is a lifestyle issue. While there are specific interventions to help with eating too little, interventions work well when the right environment and attitudes are in place. It is important for the entire family to follow, model and reinforce the behaviour we expect of the children. Working together and supporting each other is important."

    "text": "Setting up the environment and attitude\nThe family should have a good routine for waking up and getting physical activity in the morning. It is important to drink water to stimulate bowel movement and build a sense of hunger. This is especially important for #pooreaters.\nHaving access to food throughout the day does not help with building an appetite. Food should be available at fixed time intervals that are part of a schedule. Even if a child ate poorly at breakfast, giving them a large glass of milk as a mid-morning snack may not be a good idea, as it interferes with the next meal.\nRelying on children’s hunger and letting them starve if they do not eat also does not help build good eating habits. Again, most neurodiverse children have poor interoception - they may not understand the relationship between eating, feeling full and that satisfaction leading to good quality time. If we let them starve, they may end up getting accustomed to staying hungry.\nReading books about food, learning about different kinds of food and tastes, communicating ‘I like’ and ‘I don’t like’ for foods, cooking and baking, talking about feelings while having these conversations can help in building food positivity in children.\nAll members of the family eating together as frequently as you can is important. While you eat together, talk about food and how you enjoy good food. Model to children that one can safely try new food, it is okay to try and that sometimes you may end up liking new food too!"

    "section": "Intervention for quantity",
    "text": "Intervention for quantity\n\nNotice how much food the child is able to eat, at the beginning. This is the baseline for how much the child needs to eat. Measure this in spoonfuls, bites or mouthfuls.\nMake a visual schedule for the previously decided measure and the child ticks each box as they finish each measure. We can also use tokens that the child can remove for the countdown. This helps the child track how much they have eaten and how much more is left. Predictability helps manage anxiety.\nOnce the child gets comfortable eating that portion for a few days, gradually increase the measure over a number of days. Decide the pace of increment carefully so we do not overwhelm the child with suddenly increasing demands.\nClearly inform the child whenever demand is increased.\nWith some children, preparing them with a social story helps. Writing a menu together and discussions about food also help the child to prepare himself to eat."

It is important to consider them all so we follow a proper process to help the child.\n\nThis is an activity out of the routine. Many times, haircut comes as a surprise\nSalon is usually an unfamiliar setting - the seating, the lighting, and especially the smells are all different. This can cause overwhelming sensory reactions\nThere may be difficulties associated with someone touching the child’s hair\nWearing the bib is another difficult sensory experience\nThe tools used - scissors, trimmers etc. are usually considered unsafe. These tools are very close to the child, around the face\nUsually water is sprayed on the hair, the barber holds the head, touches the face, brushes hair off etc. All of these can be sensory triggers"

There is no point doing this by force or with the child screaming and shouting.\nNaturally, we need to address all of these potential difficulties in designing an intervention to help the child. Specifically, the intervention should ensure that:\n\nThe haircut does not come as a surprise but as a routine activity that is part of a schedule\nThe child gets adequate exposure to the saloon setting gradually so that the sensory experiences are not overwhelming\n\nThe goals for this intervention are:\n\nCognitive goals\n\nBeing aware of when haircut happens - this needs an understanding of the calendar and scheduling so the child knows on which day it happens\nBeing aware of what happens during a haircut\n\n\n\nBehavioural goals\n\nCooperate and follow instructions.\nExhibit safe behaviours such as not moving, wearing a bib, not touch blade or scissors etc.\n\n\n\nEmotional goals\n\nGo through the process of haircut calmly.\nAsk for help when needed.\n\nWhile we design the intervention, we also need to understand the following.\n\nChild’s profile for understanding the language as well as mode of communication\nChild’s experiences with respect to the haircut\nSpecific challenges the child has with respect to the haircut - sensory difficulties"

However, a social story also works to help only when the child is prepared well in terms of Calendar, and going through the process step by step. A social story can also be made into a video as well. This can be read to the child multiple times during the day when they are in a neutral mood.\n\n\nPretend play\nThe child can engage in pretend play around the activities involved in haircut. They can be the barber for their toys, parents can play different roles such that the child understands what is expected.\n\n\n\nTask analysis\nBreak down the haircut into discrete independent steps. This is called Task analysis.\n\nEnter the Salon\nSit on the chair\nWear the cloth around the neck\nAllow water spray\nChoose scissors/trimmer\nAllow the cleaning brush on the face, neck and chest area.\nSit through the haircut\nRemove the bib\nSay bye"

Everyday, while marking the calendar, highlight when it is and how many days are left.\nRead the social story everyday, or once two days depending on how much time there is left.\nLet the child pretend play haircut. This may include him sitting in a chair, wearing a bib, hair sprayed with water, etc. steps being done at home. The child can also do these things to a facorite toy.\nTake the child through the steps in the task analysis slowly. For example, one day, just go to the salon and come back. Another day, enter the salon, sit in the chair, revolve and play with it and come back. Slowly, over a period of time, go further and further into the task. For example, one day the child may go, sit in the chair, play with the scissors, see the trimmer in operation and come back. Do not push to finish all the steps in one day or in a short time. Give time to the child to be comfortable in each step and progress further only when they are comfortable.\nThe child watching a parent get a haircut can also help. Using the trimmer on hands and feet can help show that it does not hurt. One can think of many different ways to provide the child with the necessary exposure and assurance!\nSlowly, over a month or so, the child will get ready for the haircut. Have a good day!"
