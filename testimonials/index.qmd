> Simply amazing. My son had mild autism spectrum disorder, but after starting the sessions with Sambhavam, I could see a drastic improvement in certain areas of his behaviour and personality. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Aditi, Nidhi, Meena, Shankari and Geetha. Special thanks to Dr. Nawab and Tanuja for OT and Speech therapy. They give a lot of importance for emotional support. Over the course, I realised that this is a very good centre for improving your child's overall development. This has benefitted a lot of children in my opinion. Thank you Chitra.

 > Sambhavam helped us understand our kid better and to explore the possibilities for our child. Chitra, the lady behind this centre has become a sounding board and wall of support for us as well. She also guided us in the correct direction beyond ABA therapy. This therapy (and the awesome therapists here) guided us to focus on the reason behind a behaviour rather than on the behaviour itself. Our son is now blossoming into a cheerful, optimistic child who is gaining confidence on his special skills. We are thankful to the team for the support over the past few years.

> Our daughter has been going here (Sambhavam Whitefield) since she was 2.3 years old, specifically for ABA therapy with Sambhavam which is operating within the school premises. This is quite unique about this school as generally you will not find this in other pre-schools. This allows our child to have interactions with other kids and at the same time get required 1:1 attention. We have seen exceptional improvements in our daughter's development  milestones ever since we got her started here. We are very happy as parents and highly recommend this place.

Lots of love shown to kids and my child loves his therapists and enjoy going to centre everyday. He has improved a lot and as a parent we could see the changes in him.

> There are many schools of thought around ABA therapy, including some not-very-positive ones. I have no conclusive judgement of my own yet, but what I do have is a year’s worth of my child’s journey at Sambhavam center. ABA therapy for my son helped us as parents equally, if not more, to understand and manage our lives around ASD. With structure and discipline being central to our routine, i can say that my son found more ways to communicate using his minuscule vocabulary.. And we possibly began to understand him better, making it relatively easier for us to navigate the everyday in this space we call autism.
Our son, now 7, is part of an integrated setup at a mainstream school, and while it’s too early to assess if this enrollment is a good decision, the credit for his school-readiness can certainly be attributed to the tenure at Sambhavam. Our greetings and gratitude to Chitra who always had all the answers to all our concerns and questions. And a very special mention to Chelsea, the centre supervisor, whose disciplined and data-oriented approach was key to our overall progress. Thank you, to one and all at Sambhavam, once again.

>  Well begun is half done! Good start is important for anything we do. We are satisfied that we started our life journey through autism in Sambhavam. Though we started the intervention service very late for our son, we could see many changes within few days. He could start following instructions, his pointing skills and sitting tolerance was improved. We realized that puzzles is his strength. Though he is still under toilet training, it is much better now. His eating habits were Improved. Thanks to Chithra for her proper guidance given to parents in every small thing in the daily routine. Thanks to Sambhavam team for their kind support. Sambhavam gave us confidence for our future journey. Keep up the good work Chithra and team!

>  Sambhavam run by Chithra and Venu was something that we stumbled upon after trying out ABA in quite a few places. What really stuck us at first about Sambhavam was the energy & passion of both Chithra and Venu. Both of them having learnt stuff the hard way, wanted to make it easy for other parents and did not want us to go through all the hardships that they had faced. What we really liked was that it was a full day program unlike the 2 hours slot that others were providing. Some of the things that our son learnt (that he had never learnt it anywhere else) was adherence to schedule, sitting tolerance for up to 6 hours, playing piano, signing, painting craftwork, we were able to control his behavior better (techniques for controlling his behavior were taught to us) and eating food by sitting in one place. A lot of the credit for this has to go to Chithra for making this happen. This was apart from all the academic learnings that were part of the schedule. A very good place for kids on the spectrum and from our own experience very helpful if you get them here as early as possible.

 > Venu was my colleague from office. He and Chithra were the ones we turned to when our son was first diagnosed with autism. They have been of tremendous help, support and guidance throughout the last 3 years. We reside in Mumbai and we have been regularly visiting Chithra for periodic assessment and therapy every 6 months. She also provides us with a program and outlines the goals/milestones to be achieved over the next 6 months. We have noticed that unlike most other centres where you have a one size fits all kind of approach; here a lot of care, attention and thought is spared towards each individual. We have seen our son make tremendous progress over these years. Thanks a lot for your care and efforts!

>  Our daughter ‘Titli’ is now almost 4 yrs old. She started going to “Sambhavam” from mid January 2016. We opted for ABA therapy because she was unable to communicate her basic needs to us. Through these last 6 months, Titli has started communicating to us through PECS and pointing to objects that she wants. Her understanding of language is now excellent. Her social skills are improving and she has also started imitating very well. We are thankful to Chithra and her team of therapists for their support, hard work, and patience. Above all, what we like most about “Sambhavam”, is their transparency and their willingness to listen to our worries. We know that Chithra is always a call away to help us. We would say that finally we can see our daughter blossoming under their guidance.
