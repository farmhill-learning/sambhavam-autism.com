The most talked about concept in the special education sphere is ‘Inclusion’ and how it can come to be. 

In education and in parenting, one cannot talk about observational learning/Modeling enough. Recently, one such thing happened in our classroom which re affirmed our belief in Modeling.

A 4 year old child comes to therapy and she also is part of the pre school that we work with. She is very social and loves to be around friends. Sometimes, she is naughty too. The teachers found it difficult to regulate the child in the group. When we intervened in the classroom with visuals for keeping good hands, the child was able to regulate herself and participate nicely. 

The teachers started doing the same. So, that classroom had visuals handy.

One day, the child pushed another girl who tried to tell her not to. Since it didn't work, a couple of children got the visual and showed her. The child immediately keeps good hands and they all started playing together. 

Such is the beauty of inclusion!.

The teachers have played a crucial role in modeling respectful behavior. We feel so grateful to witness this. 


*Please note that these interventions are shared for general guidance. Designing and executing interventions - more importantly - noticing how the child responds and modifying the interventions so the child does not get distressed, is a specialist job. Consult qualified therapists as necessary.*
